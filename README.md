# Svelte and Leaflet Demo

This is a demo application using Svelte and Leaflet to visualize the US Census "Metro Area-to-Metro Area Migration Flows‚Äù dataset.

This repository contains two versions of the application. The `full` directory is the
finished product, while the `skeleton` directory just contains a basic shell, which I
fill in during the presentation to build into the complete app.

Developed for a presentation to JavascriptLA on November 11, 2020.
